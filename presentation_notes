Questions to be answered

What triangulation is used in Matlab?
    - pdetoolbox uses Delaunay
    - the triangulation is refined with a simple algorithm to split the edges

Why are there different triangulations?
    - Algorithms differ in performance. Many times algorithms are selected due to simplicity of implementation or speed rather than optimal or even close to optimal output.

How does Delaunay refinement approach work?
    - 

Why it should or shouldn't be used?
    - Should: to obtain minimum angle bound
    - Shouldn't: ?

What's the difficulty in implementing Delaunay refinement
    -

        - Limitations
        - Benefits
            

    How does Delaunay refinement approach work?
        - Nice pictures of different phases of triangulation
        - Slide or two about the mechanics


    Implementation
        - What's the difficulty in implementing Delaunay refinement?

    Math
        - When does the algorithm halt
        - (Size optimality)
        - (Bound on number of vertices)

Results
    - Nice pictures of more complex triangulations
